## Definitions in English

> A [Machine](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/machine) is a [device](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/device) that directs and controls [energy](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/energy#English), often in the form of [movement](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/movement#English) or [electricity](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/electricity#English), to produce a certain [effect](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/effect). 

A computer is a type of machine and so is a robot, car, bicycle, drone or an autonomous system.

> An [Abstract Model](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/abstract_model#English) or merely [Model](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/model#English) is a [representation](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/representation) of a physical object that contains an [abstraction](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/abstraction#English) of [reality](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/reality#English).

Models are useful to analyse machines, including their architecture, performance, property and behaviour.

## Computer Architecture 



> a computer architecture is the structure of a computer system made from component parts. It can sometimes be a high-level description that ignores details of the implementation.
