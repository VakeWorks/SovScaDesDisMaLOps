# Digital Sovereignty

According to [The World Economic Forum](https://web.archive.org/web/20250822202008/https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/01/europe-digital-sovereignty/) 
> Digital sovereignty, cyber sovereignty, technological sovereignty and data sovereignty refer to the ability to have control over your own digital destiny – the data, hardware and software that you rely on and create. 
> 
> ... the physical layer (infrastructure, technology), the code layer (standards, rules and design) and the data layer (ownership, flows and use).

Let us see some recent examples of violations of digital sovereignty due to the lack of machine sovereignty.
 
## Two recent examples

- Example 1: [Microsoft admits it 'cannot guarantee' data sovereignty 2025-07-25](https://web.archive.org/web/20250822170147/https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/25/microsoft_admits_it_cannot_guarantee/)

> Microsoft says it "cannot guarantee" data sovereignty to customers in France – and by implication the wider European Union – should the Trump administration demand access to customer information held on its servers.

- Example 2: [The US is sanctioning judges from the ICC](https://web.archive.org/web/20250822172214/https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/international-criminal-court-deplores-new-sanctions-us-administration-against-icc-officials)

> The International Criminal Court (ICC) deplores the additional designations for sanctions which were announced today by the United States of four judges of the Court: Second Vice-President Reine Adelaide Sophie Alapini Gansou (Benin), Judge Solomy Balungi Bossa (Uganda), Judge Luz del Carmen Ibáñez Carranza (Peru) and Judge Beti Hohler (Slovenia). These additional designations follow the earlier designation of Prosecutor Karim A.A. Khan KC.
>
> These measures are a clear attempt to undermine the independence of an international judicial institution which operates under the mandate from 125 States Parties from all corners of the globe. The ICC provides justice and hope to millions of victims of unimaginable atrocities, in strict adherence to the Rome Statute, and maintains the highest standards in protecting the rights of suspects and the victims. 


## The USA PATRIOT Act gives US Gov Access

- [USA PATRIOT Act vs SecNumCloud: Which Model for the Future?](https://web.archive.org/web/20250822223116/https://dzone.com/articles/usa-patriot-act-vs-secnumcloud-future-model)

> The USA PATRIOT Act was passed in 2001 after the September 11 attacks to expand government agencies' powers in surveillance and counterterrorism. In practice, it grants U.S. authorities broad surveillance capabilities, allowing access to data from companies under American jurisdiction, regardless of where it is stored.

> The adoption of the [US CLOUD Act](https://web.archive.org/web/20250725133829/https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4943) in 2018 further strengthened this authority. It requires American companies to provide data upon request, even if the data is stored on servers located in Europe.

> The extraterritorial nature of these laws forces American companies to hand over data to U.S. authorities, including data stored in Europe. This creates a direct conflict with the GDPR. For European businesses using American cloud services, it opens the door to potential surveillance of their strategic and sensitive data.

> Beyond confidentiality concerns, this situation raises a real challenge to digital sovereignty, as it questions Europe’s ability to manage its own data independently and securely.

## SecNumCloud for Digital Sovereignty

- [USA PATRIOT Act vs SecNumCloud: Which Model for the Future?](https://web.archive.org/web/20250822223116/https://dzone.com/articles/usa-patriot-act-vs-secnumcloud-future-model)

> In response to these challenges, France developed SecNumCloud, a cybersecurity certification issued by ANSSI (the National Cybersecurity Agency in France). It ensures that cloud providers adhere to strict security and data sovereignty standards.

> SecNumCloud-certified providers must meet strict requirements to safeguard data integrity and sovereignty against foreign interference. First, cloud infrastructure and operations must remain entirely under European control, ensuring no external influence — particularly from the United States or other third countries — can be exerted.

> Additionally, no American company can hold a stake or exert decision-making power over data management, preventing any legal obligation to transfer data to foreign authorities under the CLOUD Act.

> Just as importantly, clients retain full control over access to their data. They are guaranteed that their data cannot be used or transferred without their explicit consent.

> With these measures, SecNumCloud prevents foreign interference and ensures a sovereign cloud under European control, fully compliant with the GDPR. This allows European businesses and institutions to store and process their data securely, without the risk of being subject to extraterritorial laws like the CLOUD Act.

> SecNumCloud ensures strengthened digital sovereignty by keeping data under exclusive European jurisdiction, shielding it from extraterritorial laws like the CLOUD Act. This certification is essential for strategic sectors such as public services, healthcare, defense, and Operators of Vital Importance (OIVs), thanks to its compliance with the GDPR and European regulations.

> ANSSI designed SecNumCloud as a sovereign response to the CLOUD Act. Today, several French cloud providers, including Outscale, OVHcloud, and S3NS, have adopted this certification.

> SecNumCloud could serve as a blueprint for the EUCS (European Cybersecurity Certification Scheme for Cloud Services), which seeks to create a unified European standard for a sovereign and secure cloud.

## US-owned "Sovereign EU Clouds"

> Regardless of Amazon's data sovereignty pledge, the parent company remains under American ownership, and may still be subject to the Cloud Act, which requires US companies to turn over data to law enforcement authorities with the proper warrants, no matter where that data is stored.
> 
> As Frank Karlitschek, CEO of Germany-based Nextcloud, told us in March: "The Cloud Act grants US authorities access to cloud data hosted by US companies. It does not matter if that data is located in the US, Europe, or anywhere else."
