# Machines and Models

## Definitions in English

> A [Machine](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/machine) is a [device](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/device) that directs and controls [energy](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/energy#English), often in the form of [movement](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/movement#English) or [electricity](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/electricity#English), to produce a certain [effect](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/effect). 

A [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer#Digital_computers) is a type of machine and so is a robot, car, bicycle, drone or an autonomous system.

> A [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer) is a [machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine) that can be [programmed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming) to automatically carry out sequences of [arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic) or [logical operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_operations) ([computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation)). 
> Modern [digital electronic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_electronic) computers can perform generic sets of operations known as [programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program), which enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks.
> A computer system
> - includes the [hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware), [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system), [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software), and [peripheral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral) equipment needed and used for full operation; 
>  - or to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a [computer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network) or [computer cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cluster), 
>    - whose newest manifestation is [cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing). 
>      - Cloud computing is "a paradigm for enabling network access to a scalable and elastic pool of shareable physical or virtual resources with self-service provisioning and administration on-demand," according to [ISO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization).

> An [Abstract Model](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/abstract_model#English) or merely [Model](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/model#English) is a [representation](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/representation) of a physical object that contains an [abstraction](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/abstraction#English) of [reality](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/reality#English).

Models are useful to analyse machines, including their architecture, performance, property and behaviour.

## Computer Architecture

> [von Neumann Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture) gives the model of a computer with a central processing unit (CPU), memory unit and I/O devices (right)
>
> A [computer architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture) is the structure of a computer system made from component parts. It can sometimes be a high-level description that ignores details of the implementation.

## Computer Hardware

> [Computer hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware) includes the physical parts of a [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer), such as the [central processing unit (CPU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit), [random-access memory (RAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit), [motherboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard), [computer data storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_data_storage), [graphics card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_card), sound card, and computer case. It includes external devices such as a monitor, mouse, keyboard, and speakers.

## Multi-Core Processor

> A multi-core processor (MCP) is a microprocessor on a single integrated circuit (IC) with two or more separate central processing units (CPUs), called cores to emphasize their multiplicity (for example, dual-core or quad-core). 

<iframe src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor" height="500" width="100%" title="Proprietary software"></iframe>

## Graphics Processing Unit

> A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit designed for digital image processing... GPUs were later found to be useful for non-graphic calculations involving embarrassingly parallel problems due to their parallel structure. 
> The ability of GPUs to rapidly perform vast numbers of calculations has led to their adoption in diverse fields including artificial intelligence (AI) where they excel at handling data-intensive and computationally demanding tasks.

## Computer Software

> [Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software) consists of [computer programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) that instruct the [execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_(computing)) of a [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer).

## Linux, GPL and Distros

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Tux.svg"  width="50" align="left" alt="OS"></a>

> Linux (/ˈlɪnʊks/ LIN-uuks) is a family of [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) [Unix-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) operating systems based on the [Linux kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel), an [operating system kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)) first released on September 17, 1991, by [Linus Benedict Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds). Linux is typically [packaged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager) as a [Linux distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution) (distro), which includes the kernel and supporting [system software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_software) and [libraries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing))—most of which are provided by third parties—to create a complete operating system, designed as a clone of [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) and released under the [copyleft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft) [GPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPL) license.
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/GPLv3_Logo.svg" width="100" align="right" alt="OS"></a>

There are many Linux distros but we will use [Ubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu) and [Alpine Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_Linux) in [docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)) [containers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating-system-level_virtualization).
