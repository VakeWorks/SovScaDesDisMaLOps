## What is Git and why use it?

- Git is an open-source distributed version control system (DVCS) that allows developers to track and manage changes to their codebase.
- Git was developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for Linux kernel development. 
- Many "free" hosted git providers exist: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc. 
- It's easy to run your own git server, in addition to at least two hosted git providers, to ensure digital sovereignty.
