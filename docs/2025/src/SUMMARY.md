### THM.1 Data Engineering Sciences and Distributed Machine Learning Now

- Data Engineering Sciences and Distributed Machine Learning today is (matematics + statistics + computing + micro-economics ++ domain-expertise and entrepreneurship)

### THM.2. Laws of Capitalism

- VIEW: [Laws of Capitalism Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmtuEaMvhDZZ34Ltok-LB5tpfus2_6xW8&feature=shared) [140 minutes]
    - The laws of capitalism have elevated the interests of the few above that of the many, but we can rewrite the code and restore balance to society. In this series, Professor Katharina Pistor (Columbia Law School) breaks down the history, process, institutions, and participants involved in the legal coding of capital. She shows us how private actors have harnessed social resources to accumulate wealth, generating not only economic inequality, but inequality in law. Enabling them to opt out of jurisdictions, restrict governmental policy, and erode democracy. Learn more at http://lawsofcapitalism.org/
