# Sovereign Operations

We need sovereign deployment of our algorithms and operations to possibly provide SovScaDesDisMaLOps-based services that create "value" to help build a better world through an Algorithms-Machines-Operations-Lives-Planet perspective.
 
- Ideally we want to learn tools that can ease `JAM-sky-*` deployment of our ray services in an arbitrary State's jurisdiction by learning from `DPRAMJAM-local-Sverige` on our laptops, to be able to deploy to various `DPRAMJAM-sky-STATE`s with little extra effort.
- To do this, beyond command-line, docker and local ray clusters, we need to build further with:
  - kubernetes
  - terraform.io
  - ...
  
You can study these on your own from the provided references or take the WASP PhD course 
ScaDaMaLe with me in 2026 fall.
