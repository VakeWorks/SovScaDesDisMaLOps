# Sovereign Operations

We need sovereign deployment of our algorithms and operations to possibly provide SovScaDesDisMaLOps-based services that create "value" to help build a better world through an Algorithms-Machines-Operations-Lives-Planet perspective.
 
- Ideally we want to learn tools that can ease `JEM-sky-*` deployment of our ray services or others in an arbitrary State's jurisdiction by learning from `DPRAMJEM-local-Sverige` on our laptops, to be able to deploy to various `DPRAMJEM-sky-STATE`s with little extra effort.
- To do this: 
  - on the software and data and MLOps **engineering and security** side, beyond command-line, docker and local ray clusters, we need to build further with:
    - [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
    - [terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform)
    - ...
  - to build innovative and efficient distirbuted algorithms we need **mathematical analysis of algorithms**
  - to work in uncertain environments in classical probabilistic sense we need **statistics** and **learning theories**
  - to create scalable innovative products and services that can be **profitable in a business sense** we need **statistical contract theory**  to deal with information asymmetry in real-world contracts
  - to ensure **digital autonomy** and digital sovereignty of operations we need to:
    - first understand current affairs in its geopolical economic complexities and work towards anti-dependence starting with our own digital habits
    - support such services or help create them
