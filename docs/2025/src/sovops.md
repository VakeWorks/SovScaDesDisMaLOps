## Summer School Survey

- This is for 15 minutes or so
- WASP PO Staff takes charge.

## Workshop Summary & Discussion 

We can Summarise and Discuss for 15 minutes or so.

We have covered a lot of ground across so many seemingly disparate fields. There will be plenty of time for you to deep dive into each topic we have covered and keep going on your own.

However, let us say what we perhaps need in a concise sentence. An attempt of mine is as follows:

> We need sovereign deployment of our algorithms and operations to possibly provide SovScaDesDisMaLOps-based services that create "value" to help build a better world through an Algorithms-Machines-Operations-Lives-Planet perspective.
 
Each of you will have your own summarising sentence about the workshop. Think of it now! Hopefully, we can discuss for 15-20 minutes about it together now.

For my summary, I would expand it as follows (you should consider expanding your own summary):

- Ideally we want to learn tools that can ease `JEM-sky-*` deployment of our ray services or others in an arbitrary State's jurisdiction by learning from `DPRAMJEM-local-Sverige` on our laptops, to be able to deploy to various `DPRAMJEM-sky-STATE`s with little extra effort.
- To do this: 
  - on the software and data and MLOps **engineering and security** side, beyond command-line, docker and local ray clusters, we need to build further with:
    - [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
    - [terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform)
    - ...
  - to build innovative and efficient distirbuted algorithms we need **mathematical analysis of algorithms**
  - to work in uncertain environments in classical probabilistic sense we need **statistics** and **learning theories**
  - to create scalable innovative products and services that can be **profitable in a business sense** we need **statistical contract theory**  to deal with information asymmetry in real-world contracts
  - to ensure **digital autonomy** and digital sovereignty of operations we need to:
    - first understand current affairs in its geopolical economic complexities and work towards anti-dependence starting with our own digital habits
    - support such services or help create them
