# Analysis of Algorithms & Operations

Putting it all together...

## DPRAMJEM: Math+Law

**DPRAMJEM := Distributed Parallel Random Access Machine Jurisdiction-Explicit Model**


- **Asymptotic analysis of efficiency of algorithms** under different AMMs
  - Abstract Machine Model (AMM)
  - SRAM: Sequential Random Access Machine Model (older computers)
  - PRAM: Parallel Random Access Machine Model (laptops and smart phones) 
  - DPRAM: Distributed Parallel Random Access Machine Model (cluster of computers or cloud)
  - SRAM PRAM and DPRAM models with 1, 2, ..., p, p+1, ... processors and a memory model
  - Work-Depth Model and Brent's Theorem
  - Example + : Addition of n numbers in SRAM, PRAM and DPRAM models 
    - we will revisit this example implemented using ray.io in a memory model
- **Legal analysis of sovereignty of operations** under **Jurisdiction-Explicit Model (JEM)** extend AMMs beyond *analysis of algorithms*
  - JEM-local-Sverige is our default model when we work in Sweden (Sverige) with sovereign infrasturcture in Sweden
    - Example: own laptops (default for this workshop), workstations, or own on-premise clouds (NuC cluster) under sovereignty of Sverige
  - many clouds in a sky: "sky computing" means your service is agnostic to a set of clouds
    - Example: [databricks](https://databricks.com) offers sky computing across some clouds: AWS, GCP and Azure 
  - JEM-sky-State extends DPRAM by specifying the Nation State of the cloud-provider's HQ, i.e., the State that can enforce contracts and regulate each cloud in the sky.
  - Examples of JEM-sky-State, a set of cloud providers under the jurisdiction of a State:
    - JEM-sky-USA includes AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.
    - JEM-sky-China includes Alibaba, Tencent, Huawei, etc.
    - JEM-sky-EU includes scaleway, OVHcloud, Exoscale, Elastx, etc.
    - JEM-sky-Sverige includes Elastx, bahnhof, etc.
  - **DPRAMJEM-sky-State** = Distributed Parallel Random Access Machine Jurisdiction-Explicit Model is the "Math+Law" model required for sovereign operations in the sky of a said State 
    - i.e., to enforce contracts or prohibit their violations or regulate possible contracts through coercive powers of the said State and not by another *State*.
- Break-time! ... *AoAO... AoAO ahhhaaaa!*
