### THM.1 Data Engineering Sciences and Distributed Machine Learning Now

- Data Engineering Sciences and Distributed Machine Learning today is (matematics + statistics + computing + micro-economics ++ domain-expertise and entrepreneurship)

### THM.2. Laws of Capitalism

- VIEW: [Laws of Capitalism Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmtuEaMvhDZZ34Ltok-LB5tpfus2_6xW8&feature=shared) [140 minutes]
    - The laws of capitalism have elevated the interests of the few above that of the many, but we can rewrite the code and restore balance to society. In this series, Professor Katharina Pistor (Columbia Law School) breaks down the history, process, institutions, and participants involved in the legal coding of capital. She shows us how private actors have harnessed social resources to accumulate wealth, generating not only economic inequality, but inequality in law. Enabling them to opt out of jurisdictions, restrict governmental policy, and erode democracy. Learn more at http://lawsofcapitalism.org/

### PRM.1: Scaling Python with Ray in a Hurry

#### User Commands

**Core commands needed to use this repository:**

1. set up ssh for your github account: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/
1. `git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:VakeWorks/SovScaDesDisMaLOps.git` # clone the superprojecct
    - `git pull` and `git status` to keep up to date with the repository
    - `git pull --recurse-submodules` to keep up to date with the repository, including its sub-modules
    - deep-dive as required for `git`-ing sub-modules: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules
1. To run ray and jupyter inside docker to learn from Sccaling Python with Ray:

```
# change directory into SovScaDesDisMaLOps and run the following docker command
docker run --shm-size=2g -t -i -v`pwd`:/home/ray/SovScaDesDisMaLOps -p8888:8888 -p6379:6379 -p10001:10001 -p8265:8265 rayproject/ray

# for jupyter lala land install it (you can do evevrything with python alone)
pip install jupyter jupytext opencv-python-headless

# to start a head node inside docker / yopu can start ray in python or jupyter dirrectly also
ray start --head --dashboard-host=0.0.0.0

# check status
ray status

# run jupyter notebook server and go to the output URL
jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser --allow-root

# Now you can navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8888/notebooks/SovScaDesDisMaLOps/scalingpythonml/ray_examples/helloWorld/Ray-Ch2-Hello-Worlds.ipynb 

```
 
#### Peparation

Core commands to create this repository, including the addition of submodues.

```
# get source codes for scaling python with ray book from VakeWorks fork
git submodule add git@github.com:VakeWorks/scalingpythonml.git

# get source codes for ray from ray-project
git submodule add git@github.com:ray-project/ray.git
```

##### Launch ray locally on your laptop in docker:

- https://docs.ray.io/en/master/ray-overview/installation.html#launch-ray-in-docker
    - untested `.sh` execution `cd ray && ./build-docker.sh` failed with `=> ERROR [2/5] RUN <<EOF (#!/bin/bash...) ` on Tuesday 27 maj 2025 18:56:43 CEST
- Falling back on prebuilt images at dockerhub for now: https://hub.docker.com/r/rayproject/ray
    - `docker pull rayproject/ray` # pull docker image for cpu from prebuilt official docker images
    - `docker pull rayproject/ray:latest-aarch64` # Use ARM-based docker images for Apple M1 or M2 MacBooks
    - `docker run --rm --shm-size=10gb -t -i rayproject/ray` # shm-size or shared memory size should be about 1/3rd of available memory on your laptop
        - Try: `ls`, `pwd`, `whoami`, `ray --version` inside docker container
        - `CTRL-D` to exit out of the docker container.
    - `docker run --rm --shm-size=10gb -t -i rayproject/ray-ml` # ray-ml doccker image for ML in ray with libraries.. will take several minutes
        - Try: `ls`, `pwd`, `whoami`, `ray --version` inside docker container
        - `CTRL-D` to exit out of the docker container.
    - `cd PATH-TO/SovScaDesDisMaLOps` and `docker run --rm --shm-size=1G -v `pwd`:/home/ray/SovScaDesDisMaLOps -t -i rayproject/ray` # mount SovScaDesDisMaLOps inside the docker container
- Local Kuberenetes based KIND cluster for deployment: https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/
    - Install: [go 1.17+](https://golang.org/) and [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation)
<!--- or [nerdctl](https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl) (for MAC nerdctl install [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/)) -->
    - `go install sigs.k8s.io/kind@v0.29.0`
    - add `export PATH="$(go env GOPATH)/bin:$PATH"` to `~/.bash_profile` so that `kind` is in your PATH. 
    - `kind create cluster` # create kubernetes in docker or kind cluster
    - `kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kind`  # Not sure what to do next? ðŸ˜…  Check out https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/
    - To modify the cluster configuration see: https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/configuration/
