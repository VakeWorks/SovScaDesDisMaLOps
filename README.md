# SovScaDesDisMaLOps

**Definition**:

**SovScaDesDisMaLOps** := Sovereign Scalable Data Engineering Sciences and Distributed Machine Learning Operations

This repository is part of the needed preparation for [Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP-AI)](https://wasp-sweden.org/) Summer School in 2025.

The ideas and concepts as well as working codes will be made availbale here for self-study and group-study for anyone who is interested in SovScaDesDisMaLOps.

## Theoretical Modules

1. Data Engineering Sciences and Distributed Machine Learning Now (math+stats+computing+economic++domain expertise and entrepreneurship)
2. Laws of Capitalism, Corporate Jurisdictions, Statistical Contract Theory, Intellectual Property Laws in Sweden 
3. Abstract Machine Models, Work-Depth Model, Brent's Theorem, and analysis of the fastest sorting algorithm in distributed parallel random access machine (DPRAM) model

## Practical Modules

1. Scaling Python with Ray in a Hurry (requirements: github account; docker desktop; up-to-date and secure laptop)
2. Deploying for Sovereign Operations in Scalable Data Engineering Sciences and Distributed Machine Learning Spaces.
